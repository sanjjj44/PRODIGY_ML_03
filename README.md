🎮 Hand Gesture Recognition using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Hand Gesture Recognition System using Machine Learning techniques.
The model is trained to recognize different hand gestures from images and classify them into predefined categories.

Unlike standard implementations, this project uses a custom dataset created manually, making the model more practical and personalized.



🎯 Objective

To develop a machine learning model capable of identifying and classifying hand gestures from image data.




📂 Dataset
